# Dynamic POC MT5

A Forex trading indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, Dynamic POC MT5 utilizes volume profiles to optimize trading strategies in the Forex market. It calculates volume profiles dynamically and displays the results as VAL (Value Area Low), VAH (Value Area High), and POC (Point of Control) curves.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Volume Profiles**: The indicator calculates volume profiles dynamically, ensuring accurate representation of market conditions.
2. **VAL, VAH, and POC Curves**: The indicator displays the VAL, VAH, and POC curves, providing valuable insights into market trends and price levels.
3. **Color-Coded DPOC Curve**: The color of the DPOC curve sections is determined by comparing the volume of the POC levels of all profiles that make up this curve.
4. **Real-Time Recalculation**: The indicator recalculates the curve in various scenarios, including chart scaling, scrolling, timeframe switching, and when a new candle appears.
5. **Regular Recalculation**: The value of the curve on the last candle is recalculated regularly, at intervals of once per second.
6. **Customizable PocPeriod**: The PocPeriod input variable allows users to determine the length of the base profile in candles.
